# cocktailcookbook

Cocktail Cookbook is a simple app made for you to choose a drink and get the ingredients
and the recipe of it from an API.

Currently the API in use comes from this link https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php where
in development mode the API key is 1. If you want to release the app, get a valid API
key.

This application has been built in Flutter. If you have an emulator in your development
environment, then you can run the app in Android Studio or Visual Studio Code.
To install and run flutter, follow the instructions of the flutter website:
https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install

Also, instead creating a development environment you can use the Apk, located in this
path: build\app\outputs\flutter-apk and install it in an Android mobile phone. For that:
1. Connect the testing mobile phone in your PC.
2. Copy the file app.apk in your phone in a directory you can find later, for example,
    downloads
3. In your mobile phone, double click on the app.apk file
4. The phone may warn you that the app is unsafe, ignore the warning and install.
5. After installing, the app icon (Flutter icon) should be displayed in your menu.
6. Open the app. Click Start.
7. Select one of the drinks.
